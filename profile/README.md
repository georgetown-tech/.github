## From Hoyas to the Hilltop.

Georgetown Disruptive Technology is the leading technology-oriented club at Georgetown University. Our goal is to provide students with the resources they need to succeed in the ever-changing world of technology. From programming to cyber security, we offer a wide range of workshops and events to help you stay ahead of the curve.

Whether it's software development, machine learning, data analytics, or graphic design, GDT is your "one stop shop" to pursue your passions and explore new interests.

## A Community Driven Approach.

One of our main focuses is the community that we create around Georgetown. All of our members are students at the University, and all of our projects are focused around the University and the surrounding area.

Whether it's a new platform for the Hoya, a machine learning project for the Cherry Blossom Festival, or a whole new, tech-driven approach for a Georgetown club, GDT is ready to create it.
